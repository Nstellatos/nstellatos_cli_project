NOTES:
Covid-19 current values for all states
- greet the user
- output states in a numbered list
- user selects state number OR enters in name of the state(needs to be converted)
    - if it is an invalid response - ask them to provide a valid response
- when state is selected it returns info about the current covid-19 data for that state
- give the user the option to go back to the list or exit
